### Challenge 2 - *2nd Degree*

**Challenge File**- 2degree.py

Write a python program that calculates the solutions of *Quadratic Equations*. No more boring calculation of zeroes and applying formulas  with this baby! 
Here is an example interaction output of the program. Of course you don't have to have exactly the same layout as I, it's only to point out mandatory features:

**Example interaction:**
    
    >>Quadratic equations are of type ax^2+bx+c = 0
    >>Insert your equation's paramenters:
    >>a = 
    2
    >>b =
    1
    >>c = 
    -3
    >>S = {-3/2;1}
